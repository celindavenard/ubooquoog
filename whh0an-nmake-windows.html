                            <p>Hey there! I need a working qt compiler with qmake, visualstudio compiler and nmake as a dockerfile. Using chocolatey to install all dependencies in the dockerfile but can't get qt-sdk to work. Does anyone else have a solution? Thanks. I'm trying to compile a Perl source and I can't seem to find a version of nmake that works with Windows 7 64 bit. I've searched all over Microsoft's website and my Googlefu seems to be failing. I am trying to get a program to work. The user guide simply states that you need to change directories in the command prompt and then use the "make" command, but this does not seem to work in Windows. The program is written in C++, and is used to scour files and remove any duplicate information from them. I've tried using Cygwin and Visual Studio, but I am not familiar enough with this to know what I'm doing wrong, and what needs to be done. How can you compile and use a makefile Install on Windows. This documentation describes how to set up a workspace for trying to compile Gazebo on Windows. It does not actually  Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!

I am trying to build the windows kernel for the x86 architecture, I run "nmake -nologo x86=" in the \base\ntos directory but the build system returns: NMAKE : fatal error U1064: MAKEFILE not found and no target specified Stop.

This page describes how to build the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver on Windows. There are three methods to build: from command line using nmake makefiles, from Powershell using MSBuild files, and from Visual Studio. I have been working on setting up a project to start playing around with libtcod, and I've gotten most of the way set up, I'm just having some issues with the last little bit of setup. I currently have a cmake project set up with two subdirectories. One being the executable, and the other being a library that should be linked to the executable at compile time. gtroot/ gt--libs/ gt----cmake-modules/ gt----boost/ gt----SDL2/ gt----libtcod/ gt--Main/ gt----. gt----CMak. Sounds like you downloaded the source code, but what you really want is the Win32 binaries. Version 5.5 is the last version that has Windows x86 and x64 binaries precompiled by the project developers. Hey! I've been learning some C at university, where we use linux computers to program. Now I want to improve some of my code and develop on windows, but I don't know how to port the makefile (or how to make them) on windows computers. Could someone please help me port this to a makefile that would work with NMake, and explain it so I know how to make it myself in the future? Thank you! # makefile # code details EXE_DIR =  EXE = $(EXE_DIR)/sorting SRC= main.c algorithms. I'm a newbie to Python environment & really struggling to install SIP & PyQt on my Win 7 machine.

I'm trying to build ruby on windows. Base for my tries is `C:\Dev\Ruby`, sources are in `C:\Dev\Ruby\_source`, build directory is `C:\Dev\Ruby\_build`. Now, I think I managed to get everything working, but the way I'm doing it is a bit clunky and I sure there is a better way. Problem is with `zlib` and `openssl`, since it's the same issue, I'll talk only about `zlib` from here on. The ruby building code isn't able to build `zlib` extension by itself. Can I somehow provide path where. In the last few years VC++ team have done some awesome work with profile guided optimizations (PGO). PGO improves performance of certain code paths which are more likely to be used in production environments. Hi, I've installed WSL and enabled the developer mode in order to be able to run the new SSH server in Windows 10. My hope was that I could SSH into my Windows machine from my Mac to compile some source codes with visual studio's nmake. I can connect via SSH and everything seems to work fine, however . when I try to run "cl.exe" (which is the compiler) just nothing happens . after half a second or so it just prints an empty line into the console and exists cl.exe . no prints, no output 
Generators The default generator for UNIX is Unix Makefiles, and on Windows is NMake Makefiles or MSBuild depending upon the setup. Run cmake --help to list all the generators available for your platform. So I'm making a tool for my job that should make a lot of people's lives easier. I made it in VBA, but now it can only open with Excel and acts funny when other Excel windows are open and I think it would be a lot cleaner and nicer in Python, which I've dabbled in. However, I've never made a GUI before with Python. I got Qt Creator, and made my perfect layout, even better looking than my VBA one. I had read that it is pretty easy to turn that .ui file into a .py, with pyuic. Prerequisites. While multiple versions of GraphicsMagick may be installed at one time, if your intention is to replace a prior installation of GraphicsMagick with a newer version, then it is wise to uninstall the existing GraphicsMagick (see uninstall procedure) prior to installing the newer version. I've been successfully developing several PHP extensions for data processing both on Windows and Linux. In addition to that, I have many OpenCV projects on both operating systems fully working. Recently I've been trying to create a PHP extension for PHP 7.2 using the official SDK on Windows. I could easily compile it with nmake and it loaded without any problem. Then I compiled an OCR library of my own that uses OpenCV 3.2 and linked it to an exe and it worked too. The I try linking GLST. The GLST module is an implementation of SMTP Grey Listing, available for the Unix and Windows platforms. GLST is implemented in C and it uses the GDBM database interface to store its metadata. Recently, I have encountered a problem ( where using VS2017's nmake to build and install from source fails as oppose to using VS2015's nmake which has no problem. Where can I read about the difference between the two and why such situation occurs. So I've been trying to link the libgd (https://github.com/libgd/libgd) library to a project in MSVC, problem is that no matter what, I keep getting linker errors like such: error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__gdImagePng@8 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__gdImageColorAllocateAlpha@20 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__gdImageColorAllocate@16 error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__gdImageDestroy@4 error LNK2001: unresolved.

I'm trying to create a compiling lab for class, but I'm having issues finding a game that meets the following requirements. Does anyone know of any games I can use? The students are supposed to compile and install the game, and then they get to play it as a reward--this is part of a larger lab that also includes setting up the computer.

I'm continuing on a task of converting a functioning perl script (that I currently use on a linux pc) to a functional windows exe. I've tried a few things, and have come to determine that I have to perform said conversion from my windows PC with perl installed. My script uses CURL to (i think) basically grab a web page. I've been trying to install the curl package WWW-CURL via cpan on my pc, but it fails stating: gtSorry, no automated install is available on Windows, please. Up until now I have always compiled my programs from within the Visual Studio IDE, basically by pressing the little play button. :) Some time ago I was experimenting with Linux and got introduced to compiling my code from the command line. At that point I didn't really research how to use the whole MAKE system because I had already decided that Linux isn't what I need, for now. So, I'm still on the Windows side of things. However, I find myself getting more and more interested in the more "unde. $errorcode = (Start-Process -FilePath $somepath -ArgumentList $someargs -NoNewWindow -PassThru -RedirectStandardOutput $somefile -RedirectStandardError $errorfile -Wait).ExitCode Is there a way to make both the standard error and standard output go to same place?
