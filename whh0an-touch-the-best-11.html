I posted this comment in a thread the other day and wanted more people to see it. My belief is that the bengals offseason thus far has done nothing but indicate the focal point of the Bengals offense is moving from AJ Green to Joe Mixon. From a roster building standpoint they have done a lot. They drafted arguably the best OL in the draft at 11 with Jonah Williams (https://twitter.com/pff\_bengals/status/1124100786483544065?s=21 (https://twitter.com/pff_bengals/status/1124100786483544065. Background: Got married 15 years ago when we were 21 years old as virgins, have always had a weekly sex life but fairly lackluster with low interest on her part. We both thought that’s just how she was. Then six weeks ago, she told me she’s developed intense attraction for someone else and wants to open up our marriage to explore this side of herself. I deliberated then said no, she agreed and cut contact, but also said now she didn’t know if we have a future and she’s pessimistic It’s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in. First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never.

Thank You Minecraft: My Love Letter to a Beautiful Game 2012 was a pretty forgettable year. Not much happened, well, aside from seeing a videogame that would practically change my life. 8 year old me was at my cousins house, running around with them and my siblings. Once we were all worn out, my cousins booted up their Xbox and asked if we wanted to play. They were older, around 11 or 12 at the time, so me and my little brother just went along with what they chose. What game did they pick?. While the playoffs may be raging on -- there are 14 teams sitting at home with nothing to do than spin the wheel and sim the lottery on tankathon. ( With them and their fans in mind, I wanted to trickle in some draft talk up until the lottery unfolds for real in a few weeks. And of course, the biggest storyline to come out of that night will be: who landed the # 1 pick? A.K.A. Who landed Zion Williamson? On the other end, you have to presume Zion Williamson is wonder. # March onwards!

Once again, this is not really about themes and visual customizations (Disclaimer: The following will be biased to some extent, I am a Palace fan after all) The 18/19 season has been very strange as a Palace fan, quite possibly the strangest I've ever seen in my lifetime. A mix of underwhelming success and some top level statistics having somehow finished in 12th place has left the fan base largely divided on several topics.

It started with tunnel vision, then an aura, then a carsick feeling, then agonizing pain. In the months following I continued to have episodic migraines that were much less structured, usually without an aura. I still had crippling. 
Today, I wanted to revisit an old favorite, and teach you another way to make Mapo Tofu. Mapo Tofu is one of those dishes with like a mountain of different variants. And like all classic dishes where that’s true, anyone that loves Mapo Tofu tends to have a very highly developed opinion as to why their variant of choice is the best one. Perhaps the most fundamental difference in Mapo Tofu style is whether you prefer ‘stewed’ or ‘slurry-based’. The most traditional Mapo Tofu was made witho. What Is Acer Touch Screen Laptops?
