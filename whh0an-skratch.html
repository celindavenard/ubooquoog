I'm looking for a new drink supplement to add to my water for electrolytes. I've used NUUN and a couple generics from Amazon, but I want to know your recommendations! My main complaint with the tablets is they are meant for a 16oz bottle, and most of my bottles are different sizes ranging from 18-24. Stay hydrated out there. 
 I normally don't have much of a strategy for electrolytes. A couple questions : Nuun. It's effervescent. I completely avoid drinks with bubbles as I easily bloat. Is nuun 'bubbly'? Another option I would consider trying is chewable salt tablets. What are the best ones? Which I’ve been using HEED (High Energy Electrolyte Drink) from Hammer Nutrition for years, but it seems to be getting harder to find. I figure I can give some others a try, so what are your favorites? My priorities are performance, taste, and cost - and I prefer to buy 30+ serving containers. Posting this here also from another thread. Me and a friend rode from Memphis to Nashville on a bike tour (roughly 250 miles). The first two days I felt fine however the last day we rode 80 miles in the direct sun with around 90 degrees at a fast pace. I did notice I wasn’t drinking as much water as I probably should however I had made sure to put down plenty of endurolytes and skratch mix. Apparently it was not enough as I am now in the hospital with critical hyponatremia (admission labs showed.

Better scratching, transitions, beat juggling etc. I watch someone like DJ craze and see myself at that level one day.hopefully. Hello all, I'm looking to transition from producing as a hobby to dj'ing as a hobby. I want to play classic soul / funk / disco but also explore 90's hip hop and modern downtempo music in my sets. Would also like to experiment with some latin sounds or anything eclectic -- a "lounge" set would be ideal (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q692lHFaLVM I know Ableton well and have used Trakto. 
Hey all. I got a controller recently for my birthday and while I have been able to learn a few of the basics and get some rudimentary skills down, I want a more encompassing understanding of how to DJ. Can anyone recommend a good online program? I am more than happy to pay for one. I understand there is a lot of free content out there but it seems that you kind of have to know what to look for when it comes to learning new things. Maybe I am just being impatient Not too long ago, I found a Hercules RMX in my garage. It actually used to belong to my dad, and he decided to give it to me. Now, the mixer is quite an old model. It is very well usable however. I've been a fan of old Polish hip-hop, and the technique of scratching/cutting is very, very common in our music, sometimes being supportive in the chorus, or almost always being at the end of the song. It's really nice and over time I came to love it, but don't know how. So yes, I'm quite an amateur. Absolute Is pushing it out to 50 going to be a big challenge? where I live is relatively.
